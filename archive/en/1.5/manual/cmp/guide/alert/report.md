# O&M Report

If you want to receive an analysis report of the cluster running status regularly (daily or weekly), try the O&M report.

With a task report created, the system will automatically collect the cluster data within a period of time and generate a visual report, from which you can see the cluster status during that time, such as alarms and machine loading.
