With the advent of 5G and IoT era, the number of Internet smart terminal devices has grown dramatically, and the traditional model of centralized storage and computing in the cloud computing center can no longer meet the demands of terminal devices for timeliness, capacity and computing power. It has become the main development trend of cloud computing to settle cloud computing capabilities to the edge side and device side, and to deliver, operate and control uniformly through the center.

The following is a typical application scenario of store:

Edge applications usually have problems such as scattered computing resources, complex network situations and resource constraints. Although the business is relatively simple, it is not easy to maintain an application with a large number of edge nodes. The traditional way is to assign staff to the site at each stage to deal with installation, upgrade and troubleshooting of the application.

The edge computing platform of Erda aims to solve the problem of managing edge applications, settle the capabilities of Kubernetes to edge nodes and abstract the concepts of sites, applications and configuration sets. Application admin can manage scattered edge applications on a unified platform, significantly reducing the cost of operating and maintaining edge applications.
