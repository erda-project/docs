# Network Blocking

Enterprise administrators can set enterprise-level network blocking, after which all applications are prohibited from updating or releasing. You need to apply for approval from the enterprise administrator if necessary.

## Enable Network Blocking
Go to **Org Center > Settings > Deploy > Block Network**.

Once enabled, all applications in the corresponding environment in the organization cannot be upgraded or released.
