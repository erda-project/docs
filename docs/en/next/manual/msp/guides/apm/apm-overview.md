# Overview

In the background of the comprehensive cloud era, distributed microservice architectures are emerging constantly, and the number of applications is increasing dramatically, with various and complex exceptions. The original operation and maintenance methods can no longer meet the basic demands of O&M engineers, resulting in lower analysis efficiency and higher O&M costs.

The application performance management (APM) of Erda aims to help O&M engineers quickly locate issues in distributed architectures and free up their manpower. Currently, Erda APM covers multidimensional data such as logs, traces, and metrics.

With Erda APM, you can solve all kinds of O&M issues easily and efficiently.
